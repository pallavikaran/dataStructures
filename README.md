# dataStructures
For most data structures, you need to know how to 
• Insert a new data item. 
• Search for a specified item. 
• Delete a specified item.

1. Array: Quick insertion, very Slow search, fast access if index slow deletion, known. fixed size.
2. Ordered array: Quicker search than Slow insertion and unsorted array. deletion, fixed size.
3. Stack: Provides last-in, Slow access to first-out access. other items.
4. Queue: Provides first-in, Slow access to first-out access. other items.
5. Linked list: Quick insertion, Slow search. quick deletion.
6. Binary tree Quick search, insertion, Deletion algorithm deletion (if tree is complex. remains balanced).
7. Red-black tree Quick search, insertion, Complex. deletion. Tree always balanced.
8. 2-3-4 tree Quick search, insertion, Complex. deletion. Tree always balanced. Similar trees good for disk storage.
9. Hash table Very fast access if Slow deletion, key known. Fast insertion. access slow if key not known, inefficient memory usage.
10. Heap Fast insertion, deletion, Slow access to access to largest item. other items.
11. Graph Models real-world Some algorithms are situations. slow and complex.
